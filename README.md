# TDK Kannada Sangha Landing Page

A static, single-page site inspired by cultural association portals. It features hero messaging, mission highlights, programs, event listings, gallery tiles, donation pledge form interactions, and contact/newsletter sections.

## Getting started
1. Serve the site locally with `./serve.sh` (defaults to http://localhost:8000).
2. Or open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build tools required).
3. Edit section content in `index.html` to match your organization.
4. Adjust branding colors and layout in `assets/css/style.css`.

## Notes
- Buttons in the donation and newsletter forms only show acknowledgement alerts; hook these up to your preferred backend or payment provider to capture real submissions.
